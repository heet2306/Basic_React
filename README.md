**Step-by-Step Commands for React Setup:**
**1.Install create-react-app globally using npm:**
npm install -g create-react-app

**2.Create a new React application:**
create-react-app my-app

**3.Navigate into the project folder:**
cd my-app

**4.Start the development server:**
npm start

**npm (Node Package Manager)**
npm is a package manager for JavaScript, used to manage libraries, tools, and packages in the Node.js ecosystem. It allows you to easily install, update, and remove modules in your project.

**Key Points:**

Global vs Local Installation:
**Global Installation** (-g flag): When you install a package globally, it becomes available system-wide and can be used in any project. Example:
npm install -g create-react-app

**Local Installation:** When you install a package locally, it’s available only in the current project and stored in the node_modules folder. It is commonly used to manage project dependencies. Example:
npm install react

**npx (Node Package Executor)**
npx is a tool bundled with npm that allows you to run Node packages without having to install them globally or locally. It’s useful for one-time commands or utilities.

Key Points:
**Temporary Execution:** npx runs a package only for the duration of the command, without installing it permanently.

**Automatic Package Download**: If the required package is not already installed, npx will automatically download it, execute it, and then remove it.

**Examples:**
Create a React app without installing create-react-app globally:
npx create-react-app my-app

Run a GitHub repository:
npx degit <repo-url>

**JSX (JavaScript XML)**
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, primarily used with React. It allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, making it easier to define user interfaces.

Key Points:
**HTML-like Syntax:** JSX allows you to write HTML-like elements inside JavaScript. It’s later converted into React code that the browser can understand.

**JavaScript Expressions**: You can embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using curly braces {}. This allows for dynamic content within your UI.

**Example of JSX:**
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

**This JSX code is equivalent to:**
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
