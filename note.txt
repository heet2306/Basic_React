npm (Node Package Manager) npm is a package manager that manages libraries, tools, and packages in the Node.js ecosystem. It helps you install, update, and remove modules.

Key Points:

Installation: You use npm to install packages. When you install a package, it gets installed in your projectâ€™s node_modules folder.

Global and Local Installation: You can install packages globally or locally with npm. When you install globally, the package becomes available system-wide. When you install locally, it is specific to your project.
Examples:

Global installation: npm install -g <package-name>
Local installation: npm install <package-name>
You use npm to manage packages, like installing React (npm install react).

npx (Node Package Executor) npx is a tool that comes with npm, but it serves a slightly different purpose. The main function of npx is to temporarily execute a package without having to install it first.

Key Points:

Temporary Execution: npx is used to run any package directly without installing it globally or locally.

Automatic Package Download: If the package you want to run is not installed on your system, npx will automatically download and run it.


One-time Use: You use npx to run a package for a one-time task, like creating a React app or running a quick test of a tool.
Examples:

npx create-react-app my-app: This command temporarily runs the create-react-app tool to create a new React app without installing it globally.
npx degit <repo-url>: This command is used to directly download a GitHub repository.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
